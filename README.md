# website, uses jekyll

* [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* run locally with:

    ./serve

* push to test/prod with:

    ./push test|prod

Note: this website source is derived from a base template of Protos, LLC, and is licensed for use for Cognitive.

## TODO:

  * Automate the push to be run via github CI
  * Adjust nav panel header so animation works underlining text properly (perhaps javascript)
  * Redo Video
  * Google Analytics & opt-out javascript link
