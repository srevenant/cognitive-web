    global world, it’s a business imperative. A recent study shows that up to
    50% of those companies on the S&P 500 list of companies will not be on
    the list in just 10 years. In an unpredictable, global, business
    environment, companies can’t rely on traditional corporate initiatives
    to sustain and steer innovation.
